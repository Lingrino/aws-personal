# Ansible

This folder contains the ansible to configure all of my pre-built images. These are only ever used with packer so that running infrastructure never differs from the packer artifact.

There is also ansible here to configure my raspberry pi server and (in the future) other static infrastructure.

## Running Packer

The Ansible that configures packer images is not meant to be run directly. See the packer folder for examples of how it is called.

## Running Raspberry
