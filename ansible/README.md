# Ansible

This folder contains the ansible to configure all of my pre-built images. Ansible is never run against a running server, this is only ever used with packer so that running infrastructure never differs from the packer artifact.

## Running

The Ansible is not meant to be run locally. See the packer folder for examples of how it is called.
